  <p>All nagas have long, snakelike bodies covered with glistening scales, and more or less human faces. They range in length from 10 to 20 feet and weigh from 200 to 500 pounds. The eyes of a naga are bright and intelligent, burning with an almost hypnotic inner light.</p>

  <p>When resting or lying in wait, these creatures are almost impossible to distinguish from common black cloaks (the cloakerâ€™s ivory claws look very much like bone clasps). Only when it unfurls does the horrific nature of the creature become apparent.</p>
